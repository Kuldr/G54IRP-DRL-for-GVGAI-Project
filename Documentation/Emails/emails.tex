Agreed to meet on Wednesdays 2--2:30 as required.

\subparagraph{14th Novemeber}
Progress report. \\
Created a keyboard controller interface to play games. \\
Created a random agent and a way to run this on all 100 games to provide a comparison point. \\
Unable to run previous agents as none are available from the new framework although some may be available soon. \\
Could run a baseline learning implementation as discussed although this will take some time to implement and run. \\
Current research is going well ready to start work on the interim report specifically background research. \\
Will look into overleaf for sharing of the interim report drafts.
