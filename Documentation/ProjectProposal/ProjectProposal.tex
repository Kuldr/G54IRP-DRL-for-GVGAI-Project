\section{Background and Motivation}
NB:  Currently this section isn't complete as I have been doing background research to better understand what would be relevant to put in this section.

\section{Aims and Objectives}
This research project sets out to create and implement a General AI to play video games.
To test and evaluate this goal the solution developed will be tested against the GVGAI framework using the competition rules.\cite{GVGAI2014}
The project will produce an AI to play in the GVGAI framework as well as a research paper describing the performance of the AI created.
The objectives of this project are as follows:
\begin{description}
    \item [Background Research]
    Perform research into the current state of AI game playing, general AIs, and current well performing solutions to the GVGAI competition.
    The result of this background study will be used to direct the rest of the project and determine a suitable method to tackle the problem with.

    \item [Design a General AI]
    Design an AI suitable to playing general video games as presented in the GVGAI framework.
    The design and approach will be heavily influenced by the research performed earlier in the project, taking account of other previous methods both in and out of the general game playing field as well as how the problem is presented in the framework.

    \item [Develop a General AI]
    Implement and develop the design created to tackle the problem.
    This will be the primary output of the project.
    Due to the heavy reliance on the background research it isn't clear what this stage will involve.

    \item [Evaluation and Analysis of Solution]
    Compare and analyse the performance of the solution against the other entries to the GVGAI competition and potentially against human players.
    If the solution performs well there may be the ability to test them in unseen environments, such as Video Games that aren't shown in the training sets.
\end{description}

\section{Work Plan}
To help outline the project scope and schedule, a gantt chart (found in the appendix) has been created.
High level descriptions of all of the subtasks have been written out as follows.
Some parts of the work plan (specifically development) are currently very vague as the initial research needs to happen to acquire the knowledge and insight of how to proceed.
\par
Updates to the work plan will happen to break down these tasks in to more concrete steps with accurate timeframes once the direction of the project is better known.
Additional updates will also come to better reflect how long certain parts of the project will take if adjustments need to be made due to events such as increase of scope or additional commitments.

\item [\large{Other Commitments}]
\item [C1 - Welcome Weeks]
First weeks of the academic year, time set aside to allow for settling in as well as running various welcome events.
\item [C2 - Christmas Holiday]
Time off after Autumn term, Partially set aside to all for a break and time to relax..
\item [C3 - Autumn Exams]
Potentially could have exams during the entire 2 weeks so is set aside to allow for revision and the exams themselves.
This can be updated to give a better reflection of when exams will be at a later date.
\item [C4 - Easter Holiday]
Time off after Spring term, As no teaching is happening will give more time to concentrate on coursework and the presentation.
